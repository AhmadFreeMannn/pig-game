# 🎲 Pig Game

A simple two-player dice game built with Vanilla JavaScript.
Each player rolls the dice and tries to reach 100 points first — but be careful!
Rolling a 1 resets your current score, and the turn goes to the other player.

## 🧠 Game Rules

Each player rolls the dice as many times as they want.

Every roll (except 1) adds its value to the current score.

If a player rolls 1, they lose their current score, and the turn switches.

A player can “Hold” to add the current score to their total.

The first player to reach 100 points wins.

The New Game button resets everything.

## 🧩 Features

Fully functional game logic (roll, hold, new game)

Dynamic UI updates

DRY structure using an init() function

Clean event-driven design

Responsive layout with CSS
